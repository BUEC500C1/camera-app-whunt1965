# camera-app-whunt1965
This repository contains a Camera application to help us scan products, track where we found them, and protect the privacy of people captured in photos. The Application will:
- Take a picture
- Detect faces and blur them
- Read barcodes and store them
- VCapture Geotags and display images on a map

Notably: We will be connecting our application to Firebase to take advantage of cloud storage and authentication mechanism

## Phases 
In developing this project, we pursued a multi-phased approach. A description of individual phases is included below.

### Phase 1 - Setup REACT native environment
In this phase, we set up an environment to build and run a REACT native application by following this [tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

After completing the tutorial, we produced a simple REACT native application on an IOS emulator which is displayed below.

### Phase 2 - Go through REACT Native Tutorial
In this phase, we completed a simple [tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial) to create a REACT native application that can record the number of times a button is pressed.

After completing the tutorial, we produced a simple REACT native application on an IOS emulator which is displayed below.
